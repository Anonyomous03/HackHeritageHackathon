Different religious systems hold sacred law in a greater or lesser degree of importance to their belief systems, with some being explicitly antinomian whereas others are nomistic or "legalistic" in nature. In particular, religions such as Judaism, Islam and the Baháʼí Faith teach the need for revealed positive law for both state and society, whereas other religions such as Christianity generally reject the idea that this is necessary or desirable and instead emphasise the eternal moral precepts of divine law over the civil,
         ceremonial or judicial aspects, which may have been annulled as in theologies of grace over law.

        Examples of religiously derived legal codes include Christian canon law 
        (applicable within a wider theological conception in the church, but in modern times distinct 
        from secular state law), Jewish halakha, Islamic sharia, and Hindu law.

    A state religion (or established church) is a religious body officially endorsed by the state. A theocracy is a form of government in which a God or a deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler.

In both theocracies and some religious jurisdictions, conscientious objectors may cause religious offense. The contrary legal systems are secular states or multicultural societies in which the government does not formally adopt a particular religion, but may either repress all religious activity or enforce tolerance of religious diversity.

<b>Christianity</b>
Within the framework of Christianity, there are several possible definitions for religious law. One is the Mosaic Law (from what Christians consider to be the Old Testament), also called divine law or biblical law; the most famous example is the Ten Commandments. Another is the instructions of Jesus of Nazareth to his disciples in the Gospel (often referred to as the Law of Christ or the New Commandment or the New Covenant, in contrast to the Old Covenant). Another is the Apostolic Decree of Acts 15, which is still observed by the Greek Orthodox Church.[8] Another is canon law in the Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox churches.

In some Christian denominations, law is often contrasted with grace (see also Law and Gospel and Antithesis of the Law): the contrast here speaks to an attempt to gain salvation by obedience to a code of laws as opposed to seeking salvation through faith in the atonement made by Jesus on the cross. From the Gospel of John:

    <b>Biblical/Mosaic law</b>
    <br>
    Further information: Biblical law § Christianity
    Christian views of the Old Covenant vary and are to be distinguished from Christian theology, ethics, and practice. The term "Old Covenant", also referred to as the Mosaic covenant and the Law of Moses, refers to the statements or principles of religious law and religious ethics codified in the first five books or Pentateuch of the Old Testament. Views of the Old Covenant are expressed in the New Testament, such as Jesus' antitheses of the law, the circumcision controversy in Early Christianity, and the Incident at Antioch and position of Paul the Apostle and Judaism. Most Christians hold that only parts are applicable, while some Protestants have the view that none is applicable. Dual-covenant theologians have the view that only Noahide Laws apply to Gentiles. The Jewish Christianity movement is virtually extinct. According to the New Testament Christians are no longer regarded as Gentiles (Romans 8: 28–29)
    
    <b></b>Canon law</b>
    Main article: Canon law
    Canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by or adopted by ecclesiastical authority for the governance of the Christian organization and its members. It is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Anglican Communion of churches.[9] The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a church council (From Greek kanon / κανών, Hebrew kaneh / קנה, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.
    
    <b>Canons of the Apostles</b>
    Main article: Apostolic Canons
    The Canons of the Apostles[10] or Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles[11] is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the Eastern, fifty in the Western Church) concerning the government and discipline of the Early Christian Church, incorporated with the Apostolic Constitutions which are part of the Ante-Nicene Fathers
    
    <b>Catholic Church</b>
    Hinduism
The Manu Smriti forms the foundation of most Hindu law (the Smriti of Manu). Besides, there are many other scriptures that equally important as they also contributed in the development of Hindu law, including Vedas, Bhagavad Gita, etc. It was acknowledged by the British while they were governing the country. However, after independence, the legislators and prominent leaders opt to be make India as a secular country.

Islam
The moral code and religious law of Islam are known as sharia, often known as Islamic law (qanunn Islm). The commandments outlined in the Quran and the example brought forth by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Sunnahh are the two main sources from which sharia is drawn. By incorporating secondary sources, Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) interprets and expands the application of sharia to issues that aren't specifically addressed in the primary sources (the Quran and the sunnah). These secondary sources often include qiyas, analogies from the Quran and sunnah, and the consensus of the sahabah (companions of the prophet) and ulama (religious scholars) expressed in the form of ijma. The customs of the inhabitants of Medina are also included in the Maliki school of law under the heading "amal ahlil madinah."

Sharia addresses numerous issues that are covered by secular law, such as crime, politics, and economics, as well as private issues like eating, dressing, and praying, as well as issues related to inheritance and fasting. Islamic judges, or qadis, apply sharia when it has legal standing. Depending on how sharia is interpreted, the imam has several duties. While the title is most frequently used to refer to the person who leads communal prayers, the imam can also be a scholar, a religious leader, or a political figure.

Muslims disagree on the specifics of the sharia, yet they all agree that it is Allah's rule. Sharia is viewed differently by modernists, traditionalists, and fundamentalists, as well as by followers of various schools of Islamic philosophy and research. There are various ways that sharia is interpreted throughout various societies, nations, and cultures.

Islamist movements in Muslim nations have always sought to reinstate sharia. For the purpose of resolving their individual and communal disputes, some Muslim minorities in Asia (such as those in India) have continued to uphold institutional recognition of sharia. Muslim communities have developed Sharia family law for use in their own conflicts in Western countries where Muslim immigration is more recent, with varying degrees of success, for example in Britain's Muslim Arbitration Tribunal. In nations with sizable Muslim populations, attempts by Muslims to impose sharia on non−Muslims have been met with controversy, violence, and even war (the Second Sudanese Civil War).

Christianity
According to Jesus of Nazareth's life and teachings, Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion. With almost 2.8 billion adherents, or one−third of the world's population, it is the largest religion. The majority of people in 157 nations and territories are thought to be Christians, who hold the belief that Jesus is the Son of God, whose advent as the messiah was foretold in the Hebrew Bible (known as the Old Testament in Christianity) and recorded in the New Testament.

Its Western and Eastern branches, as well as its doctrines on justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology, all continue to be culturally diverse. Most Christian faiths recognise Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnate—who served, suffered, and died on a crucifixion, but rose from the dead to save mankind. He is also known as the gospel, which is a term that means "good news." The four canonical gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—describe the life and teachings of Jesus, with the Old Testament serving as the gospels' revered historical backdrop.

Jainism
Jain law, also known as Jaina law, is the current interpretation of the ancient Jain Law, which comprises regulations governing Jainists' adoption, marriage, succession, and death.2] is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the Church.[13] It was the first modern Western legal system[14] and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West,[15] predating the European common law and civil law traditions.</p>

    In contrast to religious laws, secular laws are not claimed to come from a divine source. Instead, secular laws are created by people and the government. Governments that subscribe to secularism subscribe to a philosophical and political belief system that attempts to uphold laws that are based on considerations other than a divine source. Typically, secular laws philosophically rely on natural or religiously neutral arguments such as utilitarianism (or teleological ethics) or deontological ethics.

    Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialism or teleological ethics where actions or even laws should be evaluated based on their consequences, and in opposition to the pursuit of self-interest. To a utilitarianist, if actions result in negative consequences, the action is immoral. If lawmakers are utilitarian, actions with negative consequences could be justifiably made illegal. On the other hand, a utilitarian philosopher may view certain laws that arguably lead to negative consequences to society as a whole as unjust.
    
    Deontological ethics is a branch of ethical philosophy that focuses on the relationship between morality and duty. To a deontologist, an action is moral when the action itself has characteristics of moral goodness. Deontology does not weigh the action based on its consequences, but rather on the intent of the action or the goodwill behind it. A deontologist might say "actions should be treated as ends in themselves." Where a utilitarian might see someone or something as a means to a good end, the deontologist would ask that the thing be treated as an end in and of itself.
    
    Religious philosophies may take into consideration the philosophies of deontology and teleology, and express them as ways of finding a reason behind the laws that were prescribed by a deity or divine source. However, religious laws are expressed as justifiably upholdable simply on the basis of coming from the divine; and human philosophies of morality are simply means of interpreting the reasoning or justification behind the deity's rules (which must be upheld regardless of one's own understanding of them)
