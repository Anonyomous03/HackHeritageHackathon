        <p>Administrative Law is that branch of law that deals with powers, functions & responsibilities of various organs of the State. There is no single universal definition of ‘administrative law’ because it means different things to different theorists.

            K. C. Davis defines Administrative Law is the law concerning the powers and procedures of administrative agencies, including especially the law governing the judicial review of administrative action.
            
            Administrative law is the branch of the law governing the relationship between the individual and the executive branch of the government when the latter acts in its administrative capacity.
            
            Ivor Jennings defined administrative law as the law relating to administration. It determines the organization, powers and duties of administrative authorities.
            
            Administrative law deals with the powers of administrative authorities the manner in which the powers are exercised and the remedies which are available to the aggrieved persons, when those powers are abused by these authorities.
            
            Primary function of administrative law is to keep governmental powers within the limits of law and to protect private rights and individual interests.
            
            Rule-making power (delegated legislation) and an authority to decide (Tribunal/Court) are described as effective and powerful weapons in the armory of administration.
            
            As Wade observed, all power have two inherent characteristics:
            
            (i) They are not absolute or unfettered.
            
            (ii) They are likely to be abused.
            
            Administrative law attempts to control the power of the government, and its instrumentalities and agencies. To achieve that objective, administrative law provides an effective mechanism and adequate protection. It helps to strike between two conflicting force:
            
            (i) Individual rights
            
            (ii) Public interest.</p>

        Administrative law determines the organization, powers and duties of administrative authorities. Emphasis of Administrative Law is on procedures for formal adjudication based on the principles of Natural Justice and for rule making.

        Concept of Administrative Law is founded on the following principles:
        
        (a) Power is conferred on the administration by law.
        
        (b) No power is absolute or uncontrolled howsoever broad the nature of the same might be.
        
        (c) There should be reasonable restrictions on exercise of such powers depending on the situation.
        
        Though administrative law is as old as administration itself since they cannot exist separately, in India the early signs/existence of administrative law could be found in the treatises written during the reign of the Mauryas, Guptas, Mughals as well as East India Company.
        
        It is based on the concept of rule of law that supports Natural Justice i.e. adjudication based on impartiality, unjustness and the prescribed laws and legal methods instead of arbitrariness and abuse of official power. Natural justice is basically applied in cases where there are no laws prescribed, here the individual has to be given an opportunity to be heard and the judgment is to be taken into consideration the particular facts and cases of the case and the judgment should be free from bias. It is to prevent violation of people’s rights by officials in power.
        
        Administrative law specifies the rights and liabilities of private individuals in their dealings with public officials and also specifies the procedures by which those rights and liabilities can be enforced by those private individuals. It provides accountability and responsibility in the administrative functioning. Also there are specified laws and rules and regulations that guide and direct the internal administration relations like hierarchy, division of labour etc.

    Modern state typically has three organs –

    Legislative
    Executive and
    Judiciary.
    Traditionally, the legislature was tasked with the making of laws, the executive with the implementation of the laws and judiciary with the administration of justice and settlement of disputes. However, this traditional demarcation of role has been found wanting in meeting the challenges of present era. The legislature is unable to come up with the required quality and quantity of legislations because of limitations of time, the technical nature of legislation and the rigidity of their enactments. The traditional administration of justice through judiciary is technical, expensive and dilatory. The states have empowered their executive (administrative) branch to fill in the gaps of legislature and judiciary. This has led to an all pervasive presence of administration in the life of a modern citizen. In such a context, a study of administrative law assumes great significance.
    
    The ambit of administration is wide and embraces following elements within its ambit:
    
    It makes policies.
    It executes, administers and adjudicates the law.
    It exercises legislative powers and issues rules, bye laws and orders of a general nature.
    The ever-increasing administrative functions have created a vast new complex of relations between the administration and the citizen. The modern administration is present everywhere in the daily life of an individual and it has assumed a tremendous capacity to affect their rights and liberties.

<h4>Goals of administrative Law</h4>
<br>

<p>
    The goal of administrative law is to ensure that the individual is not at receiving end of state’s administrative power and in cases where the individual is aggrieved by any action of the administration, he or she can get it redressed. There is no antithesis between an effective government and controlling the exercise of administrative powers. Administrative powers are exercised by thousands of officials and affect millions of people. Administrative efficiency cannot be the end-all of administrative powers and the interests of people must be at the centre of any conferment of administrative power. If exercised properly, the vast powers of the administration may lead to the welfare state; but, if abused, they may lead to administrative despotism and a totalitarian state.

    A careful and systematic study and development of administrative law becomes a desideratum as administrative law is an instrument of control on the exercise of administrative powers.

        <h3>Administrative Discretion</h3>
<br>
<p>
    Discretion in layman’s language means choosing from amongst the various available alternatives without reference to any predetermined criterion, no matter how fanciful that choice may be.

A person writing his will has such discretion to dispose of his property in any manner, no matter how arbitrary or fanciful it may be. But the term “discretion” when qualified by the word “administrative” has somewhat different overtones. ‘Discretion’ in this sense means choosing from amongst the various available alternatives, but with reference to the rules of reason and justice and not according to personal whims. Such exercise is not to be arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular.

Thus, in short, the decision is taken by the authority not only on the basis of the evidence but in accordance with policy or expediency and in exercise of discretionary powers conferred on that authority.

Conferment of discretion

Discretion is conferred in the area of rule-making or delegated legislation e.g. when the statutory formula says that the government may makes rules which it thinks expedient to carry out the purposes of the Act. In effect, a broad discretion and choice are being conferred on the government to make rules. Similarly, discretion is conferred on adjudicatory and administrative authorities on a liberal basis, that is, the power is given to apply a vague statutory standards from case to case.

Rarely does the legislature enact a comprehensive legislation complete in all details. More often the legislation is sketchy or skeleton, leaving many gaps and conferring powers on the administration to act in a way it deems “necessary” or “reasonable” or if it “is satisfied” or “is of opinion”.  <br>
<br>
<b>Need of discretion</b>

Because of the complexity of socio-economic conditions which the administration in modern times has to contend with, it is realized that a government having only ministerial duties with no discretionary functions will be extremely rigid and unworkable and that, too some extent, officials must be allowed a choice as to when, how, and whether they will act. The reason for this attitude is that, more often than not, the administration is required to handle intricate problems which involve investigation of facts, making of choices and exercise of discretion before deciding upon what action to take. Thus, the modern tendency is to leave a large amount of discretion with various authorities.
