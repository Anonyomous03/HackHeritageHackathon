<p> Labour law, also known as employment law or labor and employment law, is a legal framework that governs the rights, responsibilities, and relationships between employers, employees, and labor unions in the workplace.
    It covers a wide range of issues, including employment contracts, wages, working conditions, workplace safety, discrimination, and collective bargaining.
     The purpose of labour law is to protect the rights of workers and ensure fair and equitable treatment in the workplace.
      It varies from country to country and is often influenced by national legislation, international treaties, and labor standards.
